                The purpose of this app is to showcase my skills in web development. During my time at Infosys, I honed my skills in identifying and fixing code and UI issues before clients encounter them. To demonstrate my debugging skills, I chose to clone a well-established website and address any problems I found in my solution.

                The backend of my MERN app consists of five endpoints, each serving a different purpose. These endpoints incorporate validation measures to ensure basic web security, checking the provided data for the preferred type and appropriate syntax using regular expressions (regex).
                <br><br>
                <div class="container-zoomcar-description-title">Car Endpoint:</div>
                <br>
                <div class="container-zoomcar-description-title">Purpose:</div> Saves car information to the database.
                <br>
                <div class="container-zoomcar-description-title">Workflow:</div> The endpoint fetches the car image link from Google Drive, dynamically creates a URL to access the image, and saves the car data into the "cars" collection in the database.
                <br>
                <div class="container-zoomcar-description-title">Validation:</div> The endpoint validates the input data, ensuring it follows the required syntax and data types.
                <br><br>
                <div class="container-zoomcar-description-title">Cities Endpoint:</div>
                <br>
                <div class="container-zoomcar-description-title">Purpose:</div> Updates the "cities" collection in the database.
                Workflow: Each document in the "cities" collection consists of a variable named "countryName" containing country names and a variable named "cityName" containing a set of cities. The endpoint validates the input and adds new cities to the respective country's set.
                <br>
                <div class="container-zoomcar-description-title">Validation:</div> The endpoint ensures that there are no duplicate city names and performs appropriate validation for the input data.
                <br><br>
                <div class="container-zoomcar-description-title">Country Endpoint:</div>
                <br>
                <div class="container-zoomcar-description-title">Purpose:</div> Updates the "countries" collection in the database.
                Workflow: The "countries" collection contains a single file with a set named "countryName" that stores all the country names where the service is available. The endpoint validates the input and adds new countries to the set.
                <br>
                <div class="container-zoomcar-description-title">Validation:</div> The endpoint validates the input data, ensuring it follows the required syntax and data types.

                <br>
                <div class="container-zoomcar-description-title">Workflow:</div> The endpoint validates the input data and encrypts the password before saving it to the database to enhance security in case of a potential breach.

                <br>
                <div class="container-zoomcar-description-title">Workflow:</div> The endpoint validates the provided credentials, retrieves the encrypted password from the "userData" collection, decrypts it, and cross-checks it to verify the correctness of the login. If successful, the user's data is fetched and returned as the output.
